caption: 'The image captures a snowy city street scene with a vintage, classic car
  driving down the street. The car is covered in snow, indicating the wintry weather
  conditions. Several other cars are parked along the street, and a truck can be seen
  in the background.


  There are multiple people on the street, walking and going about their daily activities.
  Some are closer to the camera, while others are further away, adding depth to the
  scene. The combination of the classic car, snow-covered streets, and people creates
  a nostalgic and bustling atmosphere in the city.'
